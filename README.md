## What is openSesame?
openSesame is a facial-recognition smart lock created by Timothy Yuan, Lucas Xia, Navid Mir, Toby Fischer, and Jacob Zhang for SB Hacks V
(January 11, 2019 - January 13, 2019). This idea was thought of to find a solution to students getting locked out of their residences 
or apartments. Using our website, users simply upload a single image of each person who can be admitted entry. Then getting access is as
simple as letting the door lock mechanism take a picture of one's face.
